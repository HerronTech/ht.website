    <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
    <p> The need to modernize the IT ecosystem is a must for all enterprises to stay
      competitive, to support new business models or to simply just survive. In this digital era,
      hyperawareness, informed decision-making, and fast execution is needed to avoid
      falling into the digital vortex. Today, technology, speed, and cost are showstoppers
      instead of enablers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Business Value :</b> the “Core” features you need to build in order to modernize
        (security, oAuth, ACL, Admin Management Dashboard, etc.) have too little value
        as differentiators for your products and business applications. Instead, you need
        new and innovative APIs! Typically 60% can be spent on “Core” features,
        reducing the resources that could be better spent on business logic and
        differentiation.
      </li>
      <li><b>Lack of standardization :</b> Results in too many variables to deal with; and without
        reusable code, ongoing changes require engineers to reinvent the wheel each
        time. Add this to learning new frameworks and afterthoughts bring about the
        likelihood for errors and security issues.
      </li>
      <li><b>Insufficient Time / Resources :</b> You don’t have enough time / resources to
        rethink your entire infrastructure without drastically disrupting your organization
        and jeopardizing its revenue, stream, product delivery, customer service or other
        key components.
      </li>
      <li><b>Silos :</b> Many Technology companies / products out there claim to give you the
        right stack but they typically only cover half of your requirements and have
        monumental barriers to entry as their solutions require costly licences, stacks,
        proprietary frameworks and data models, etc.
      </li>
      <li><b>Cost :</b> As per Gartner to be successful with digital business transformation and
        optimization,CIOs and IT Leaders must work hard to reduce the IT budget and
        increase the bottom line
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>Enterprises are looking for platform based solutions and the new era of the cloud is to
      empower these enterprises with an array of product development tools to bring
      innovation in-house. The solution? Build a flexible and adaptable Enterprise Platform
      thereby allowing your organization to create innovative Business Applications. A couple
      years ago,<u>we realized the majority of organizations, even the one we were part of, had
        the same common problems.</u>They had to innovate and adapt quickly to many changes
      in their market.</p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in 2015 we went on a mission to build a smart solution to help enterprises of
      all sizes to achieve digital transformation in a quick, adaptable and efficient way,
      thereby providing the agility that is lacking. As a result we <b>launched SOAJS</b> ; an open
      source application platform initiative built by engineers for engineers for rapid
      execution at all stages of the digital transformation. SOAJS is the only complete
      Enterprise Open Source aPaaS to build auto-scaling SOA-based solutions to achieve
      the digital transformation efficiently and seamlessly. SOAJS is maintained by top-notch
      engineers around the globe as an Open Source community with the following values:
      Fast, Free, & Flexible.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make sure we were steering this initiative in the right direction, we worked closely
      with different enterprises of all sizes (from startups to billion dollar publicly traded
      enterprises) to help solve this complex problem in a versatile way. We can proudly say
      that we found the right solution that can be installed locally or on any cloud in just
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this open-source enterprise platform vision, two years ago, the Herron Tech
      founders built SOAJS and now SOAJS is ready and the market is mature:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>The IP/trademarks/brand are owned by Herron</li>
      <li>The architecture/releases/roadmap are controlled by Herron</li>
      <li> We now have a rich code base and a thriving community:</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- image should be added here -->

    <p>
      Our mission is to empower enterprises with the digital business agility required to
      respond quickly and effectively to emerging threats to their business, and proactively
      seize new market opportunities.
    </p>

    <p>
      With so much noise being generated by startups in the marketplace, we find the
      significant investments in enterprise software to be very interesting. For example, the
      Enterprise Kong API gateway developed by mashape.com and backed by Jeff Bezos and Eric
      Schmidt’s IE does a fraction of what our platform does and they have raised $18M.
      Meanwhile, Rancher Labs has raised in excess of $20M for a product limited to
      deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our platform has been tested and deployed by Corsair USA, Yellow Pages Canada, 411,
      American Botanical Council in Texas, and others. We understand the pain points and
      we can confidently claim that our platform is very mature, with many tried and true
      products being actively served.</p>
    <p>Recently, we engaged multiple enterprises (Videotron, ADP, Liquidweb, Dropbox, ING,
      Hutchinson and others). We also met with several key staff members at Rackspace, a
      premier managed cloud computing company located in San Antonio. As you may
      know, Rackspace has offices in Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Israel, The
      Netherlands , India, and Hong Kong , and data centers operating in Texas , Illinois ,
      Virginia , the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong .
      marketplace</p>
    <p>
      We had the opportunity to demonstrate our software platform on Rackspace’s cloud at
      their company headquarters in San Antonio. We met with senior staff in charge of Sales,
      Channel Partnerships, AWS Cloud, Azure Cloud and Google Cloud Platform and they
      were thoroughly impressed with the unique features and adaptability of our product.
      They are in agreement that there is no single software solution that delivers what we
      do. The only software platforms that remotely appear close are from Pivotal and
      OpenShift (but these solutions do not offer the entire platform pipeline needed today).
      In addition, they confirmed that many companies are struggling with the average of 16
      months to implement Pivotal and the multimillion-dollar entry points for OpenShift and
      Pivotal. Consequently, we believe that our SaaS version will succeed in the</p>
    <p>
      With a complete platform in place from two years of development, strong customer
      and partner validation, and almost $2.5 million of revenue on an investment of about
      $1.3 million, we believe that a substantial amount of risk for potential investors has been
      eliminated.</p>
    <p>
      What we offer is a complete <b>Enterprise Platform</b> to build autoscaling Service Oriented
      Architecture (SOA) based solutions. Our aPaaS is <b>the richest integrated and
      harmonized platform on the market</b> covering all the development pipeline needs from
      framework, API Management & Lifecycle, Continuous Integration & Delivery to Metrics.
      And, it is adapts to legacy solutions -- the enterprise does not have to adapt to it.
    </p>


    <ul>
      <li><b>API Management, Lifecycle and Gateway :</b> Build a homogenous API catalog by
        leveraging what you have. Do not start from scratch!
      </li>
      <li><b>Multi-Tenancy, Multi-Security and Multi-Environment:</b> Create economies of
        scale and accelerate time to market. Reusability is profitability
      </li>
      <li><b>Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery :</b> Release with the click of a button.
        Speed Speed Speed
      </li>
      <li><b>Cloud orchestration & distributed architecture :</b> Leverage any cloud provider
        as well as you own private cloud. Move any system you have on the cloud in
        minutes
      </li>


    </ul>

    <p>While other partners may impose costly licensing, training, clouds, data models,
      frameworks, etc., Herron Tech has no barrier to digitization and is adaptable to all
      business contexts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Framework Freedom :</b>
        Do not disrupt engineers by imposing a new framework.
        This kills agility.
      </li>
      <li><b>Container technology agnostic :</b> Do not limit yourself to proprietary
        technologies. Take advantage of Kubernetes, Swarm and other container
        technologies.
      </li>
      <li><b>Cloud agnostic :</b> Leverage any cloud provider as well as you own private cloud.
        Move any system you have onto the cloud in minutes.
      </li>
      <li><b>Data model free :</b> We don’t impose any Data model on you.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Helping enterprises delivering on these following KPIs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b> ROI:</b> No need for an army of engineers to keep up with production and product
        roadmap
      </li>
      <li><b>Speed Speed Speed:</b> Do not waste at least 2 years of core development, take
        advantage of our ready, flexible, and adaptable platform and accelerate
        time2market
      </li>
      <li><b>Quality:</b> Do not sacrifice this one at the cost of customer satisfaction. Leverage
        our mature core to guarantee the best SLA, quality infrastructure and scale
      </li>
      <li><b>Standardization:</b> No need to re-invent the wheel, use our adaptable
        “Standardized by design” core to automated and meet delivery dates
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are requesting an initial investment of at least $5 million. These funds are necessary
      to enable our company to hire the staff required to take our disruptive and scalable
      technology to the next level and will be used as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a marketing, sales, and communications team to close the initiatives we
        have started and begin converting the free downloads into paying customers.
      </li>
      <li>Hire engineers to finish the SaaS and build additional premium, non-open source
        modules on top of SOAJS.
      </li>
      <li> Hire a multi-tier support team to deliver an excellent customer experience and
        ensure customer satisfaction
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our business model is based on two software product lines that generate recurring
      monthly revenue -- an Enterprise version and a Software as a Service (SaaS) version.
    </p>
    <!-- graph goes here -->

    <p>
      The annual revenue for the next five years is forecasted in the chart below. Note that by
      year 5, our annual revenue is expected to be $62MM. Though this forecast may appear
      to be overly optimistic, we believe that it is not only reasonable but also attainable.
    </p>

    <p>In fact, as of August 2017, we have closed one in each category:</p>

    <p>
      2018 will no doubt be our most challenging year, but will serve as the launchpad for the
      future success of the company as we launch the SaaS version of SOAJS and begin an
      aggressive marketing campaign. In addition, we must build a technical support team
      and formally launch a Channel Partner program designed to attract software
      developers and digital agencies to enable them to deliver more value to their client
      base. Once established, we expect the Channel Partner program to grow exponentially
      as it creates opportunities for serving niche markets that can be best served by experts
      within a particular industry, e.g. healthcare, finance, insurance and others.

    </p>

    <p>
    With regard to enterprise sales, we expect the sales cycle to run between 3 to 6
    months and have therefore made slow but steady growth within the enterprise market.
    By partnering with cloud service providers and establishing channel partners in
    selected markets, we will augment our revenue and forge win-win relationships.</p>
    <p>
    With regard to the SaaS product sales, we expect the product to be completed by the
    end of 2017 and have anticipated using the first quarter of 2018 for marketing and filling
    the sales pipeline. We anticipate that SaaS sales will have a much shorter sales cycle,
    typically less than 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following chart reflects the number of new and cumulative clients that form the
    basis of our revenue forecast and assumes recurring revenue.</p>


    <!-- graph 2 goes here -->
    <p>
    Our plan is to methodically recruit, train, and retain our engineering and marketing staff
    and gradually increase the headcount as revenue increases. Also, as SaaS revenue
    increases and becomes a larger percentage of total revenue, we will optimise the need
    to hire additional staff. A commonly used performance indicator used to evaluate the
    efficiency of employee utilization is the amount of revenue generated per employee. </p>
    <p>
    The following table reflects the total estimated annual revenue, annual employee
    compensation, headcount and revenue per employee.
    </p>

    <!-- expensis table goes here -->

    <p>It should be noted that revenue per employee and efficiency increases each year. The
      total compensation in comparison to total revenue significantly decreases and, by the
      fifth year, our estimated revenue per employee (RPE) is inline with the “Big 4”
      technology companies, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Oracle. Our intention is to provide

    our staff with market rate compensation and benefits which include, but is not limited
    to, health care, retirement and profit sharing/stock option plans.</p>
