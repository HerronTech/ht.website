    <h1>The Disruption</h1>
    <p>
      A change is taking place and the “value vampire” within Digital Vortex will disrupt every
      single industry. A value vampire is essentially a company that uses its competitive
      advantage to shrink the overall revenue from a given market. Value vampires are
      basically an extreme form of digital disruption, and their ability to create three
      fundamental forms of value for customers— cost value, experience value, and platform
      value— is exceptional. They are hazardous to competitors because they provide a
      blueprint on how disruption occurs— one followed, to varying degrees, by a horde of
      digital disruptors bent on unseating market leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pace of technological change, business model innovation, and the blending of
      industries accelerate as companies are drawn into the Digital Vortex. So which “big
      bets” companies should place to thrive in this uncertain and highly competitive
      environment? The answer, as difficult as it may sound, is that: no single strategy will
      guarantee success. Why? Because individual moves tend to focus too much on
      tweaking the company’s existing value chain in order to compete with traditional foes
      (all of which have similar value chains), rather than transforming how the company
      delivers cost value, experience value, and platform value to customers.
      Meanwhile, digital disruptors focus on precisely that: supplying the cost value,
      experience value, and platform value customers’ want. Increasingly, a company’s most
      formidable competitor will be a start-up or a firm from another industry that uses digital
      technologies and business models to create “combinatorial disruption”— where cost
      value, experience value, and platform value are created concurrently. In such
      circumstances, “big bets” look like forceful punches from slow- footed boxers that miss
      their opponents— lots of energy, no impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      To win in the Digital Vortex, companies must be dynamic enough to understand the
      risks disruptors pose to their business, and to maximize their revenues in the face of
      tough competition. At the same time, the percentage of revenue from new businesses
      needs to increase, as margins from core businesses will frequently decline. This puts
      pressure on companies to improve the “hit rate” of marketable innovation, an area in
      which nearly all incumbents struggle. As we saw in “Digital Vortex,” incumbents are less
      able to innovate and adapt to speed than the startups that are disrupting their core
      businesses, putting them at a stark disadvantage.

    <H2>The need for a platform</H2>
    <p>
      Researchers and experts are advising companies on how to transform, they have come
      to understand that companies need to develop a “meta capability” we call “Digital
      Business Agility.” Digital Business Agility is the capability companies must develop in
      order to use digital business models to create new forms of value. Companies that
      possess Digital Business Agility respond quickly and effectively to emerging threats to
      their business, and seize new market opportunities before their rivals even notice them.
      They use combinatorial disruption to differentiate their core businesses, making it hard
      for value vampires or other disruptors to replicate or supersede the value they provide.
      When disruptors do strike, digital business agility allows companies to harvest
      maximum value from declining businesses. Most important, they can identify and
      exploit value vacancies, which all companies will need to maintain growth as some
      businesses hit disruptor-induced revenue stalls.

    </p>
    <p>Digital Business Agility has three main pillars: hyperawareness, informed
      decision-making, and fast execution.</p>
    <p>In Technology, or for an IT department, the Digital Business Agility means to have a
      flexible Platform Enterprise - “Core”.</p>
    <p>“In today’s era of volatility, there is no other way but to re-invent. The only sustainable
      advantage you can have over others is agility, that’s it. Because nothing else is
      sustainable, everything else you create, somebody else will replicate.” – Jeff Bezos,
      Amazon founder</p>
    <p>Enterprises that leverage the power of platform business models have grown
      dramatically in size and scale over the past decade. No longer the sole domain of social
      media, travel, books or music, platform business models have made inroads into
      transportation, banking and even healthcare and energy. Platforms are now active in
      North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Some platforms are household
      names such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Alibaba. Others have emerged more
      recently or hail from parts of the world that get less attention such as Rakuten (Japan),
      Delivery Hero (Germany), Naspers (South Africa), Flipkart (India) or Javago (Nigeria).
      Platform ecosystems are gaining ground through the digitalization of products, services
      and businesses processes and in the process are reshaping the global landscape.</p>

    <h2>What is a platform</h2>
    <p>Platforms have unique characteristics, with a central feature being the presence of
      network effects. Network effects are prevalent in platforms, and they mean that more
      users beget more users, a dynamic which in turn triggers a self-reinforcing cycle of
      growth. Further, most of today’s platforms are digital: they capture, transmit and
      monetize data, including personal data, over the Internet. They may not be purely
      digital; in that they may have physical elements included in the product offering, but
      most successful platforms today take advantage of the power of pervasive Internet
      connectivity in the hand of billions of users and have at their heart a software engine.</p>
    <p>Platforms create value in two principal ways. The first way, which corresponds to what
      we call transaction platforms, facilitates transactions between different types of
      individuals and organizations that would otherwise have difficulty finding each other.
      Obvious examples include Uber, Google Search, Amazon Marketplace, and eBay. This
      type of platform is sometimes called a multi-sided market.</p>
    <p>There are also innovation platforms, which consist of technological building blocks that
      are used as a foundation on top of which a large number of innovative services or
      products. These innovators can be anyone, anywhere in the world, and together they
      form what is called an innovation ecosystem around the platform. An example is the
      iPhone, which has hundreds of thousands of applications. Those applications are
      developed by innovators all over the world, who use Apple technology the company
      makes available through software connectors called APIs— application programming
      interfaces—which will in effect continue the cycle of innovation and growth.</p>
    <p>Do not be afraid of the change and do not let existing technologies frighten you. At
      Herron Tech we acknowledge the pain of Digital Agility; this why we created the SOAJS
      open source project to solve digital transformation in an adaptable way. We give you
      Digital Agility by helping you build your Platform Enterprise.</p>
    <p>We offer a complete Enterprise Application Development and Integration Platform to build auto-scaling SOA based
      solutions. Our platform is the richest integrated and harmonized platform on the market
      covering all your needs from framework, API Management & Lifecycle, Continuous
      Integration & Delivery to Metrics and it is adaptable.</p>
    <p>No need to stay awake at night because either you are not going to make it through the
      digital vertox or you are going to disrupt your company by adopting solutions that are
      available in the market today (aka: Mendix, Pivotal, Mulesoft, …); A huge barrier to adopt</p>
    <p>these technology: learning curve, getting rid of existing system in which you invested
      tons of money and the necessity to achieve digitization. With Herron Tech there are no
      barrier to digitization as explained in the table below:</p>
