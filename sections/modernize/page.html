    <h1>Get empowered with the ability to build, release, and integrate products or clients rapidly without compromising
      on security, scalability, and reliability – while staying adaptive to any architecture, deployment technology, or
      legacy systems
    </h1>
    <p>The need to modernize IT infrastructure is a must for all enterprises to become great, to remain competitive, to
      support new business models, or to simply just survive. In this digital era, hyper-awareness, informed
      decision-making, and fast execution are needed to avoid getting caught in the turmoil of the digital vortex.
      Today, technology, speed, and cost are too often showstoppers instead of enablers:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business Value:</strong> The “Core” features required to modernize (security, oAuth, ACL, Admin
        Management Dashboard,
        etc.) deliver little value as differentiators for your products and business applications. And yet 60% of your
        time can typically be spent developing these “Core” features, reducing the resources that might be better
        invested on business logic and differentiation.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Lack of standardization:</strong> The lack of reusable code requires engineers to track too many
        variables and
        reinvent the wheel each time. Add in the need to learn new frameworks and account for afterthoughts, and the
        likelihood for errors and security issues increases immensely.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Legacy Systems:</strong> pre-existing data models/frameworks/infrastructure slow everything down:
        <ol>
          <li> “Core” capabilities (security, oAuth, ACL, etc.) lack flexibility to support new applications
          </li>
          <li> Vendors impose their own data models/frameworks/infrastructure</li>
        </ol>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Insufficient Time / Resources:</strong> You don’t have enough time / resources to rethink your
        infrastructure without
        drastically disrupting your organization and jeopardizing its revenue stream, product delivery, customer service
        or other key metrics.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Silos:</strong> Many technology companies and products out there claim to give you the right stack,
        but they typically
        only cover a fraction of your requirements – and they impose monumental barriers to adoption as their solutions
        require costly licenses, additional stacks, proprietary frameworks and data models, etc.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cost:</strong> with so much effort developing core features, trying to leverage legacy systems,
        dealing with multiple
        stacks and proprietary requirements, and more, IT budgets and schedules only get worse. But as Gartner
        highlights, to be successful with digital business transformation and optimization, CIOs and IT Leaders must
        work hard to reduce their expenditures and improve the bottom line.
      </li>
    </ul>
