    <h1>Get empowered with the ability to build, release and integrate products and clients rapidly
      without compromising on security, scalability and reliability</h1>

    <p>

      The need to modernize the IT ecosystem is a must for all enterprises to stay competitive, to
      support new business models or to simply just survive. In this digital era, hyperawareness,
      informed decision-making, and fast execution is needed to avoid falling into the digital
      vortex. Today, technology, speed, and cost are showstoppers instead of enablers:
    </p>

    <ul>


      <li><b>Business Value:</b> the “Core” features you need to build in order to modernize (security,
        oAuth, ACL, Admin Management Dashboard, etc.) have too little value as differentiators for
        your products and business applications. Instead, you need new and innovative APIs!
        Typically 60% can be spent on “Core” features, reducing the resources that could be better
        spent on business logic and differentiation.
      </li>
      <li><b>Lack of standardization:</b> Results in too many variables to deal with; and without reusable
        code, ongoing changes require engineers to reinvent the wheel each time.  Especially adding
        in the need to learn new frameworks and count for afterthoughts, the likelihood for errors
        and security issues increases immensely.
      </li>
      <li><b>Insufficient Time / Resources:</b> You don’t have enough time / resources to rethink your
        entire infrastructure without drastically disrupting your organization and jeopardizing its
        revenue, stream, product delivery, customer service or other key components.
      </li>
      <li><b>Silos:</b> Many Technology companies / products out there claim to give you the right
        stack, but they typically only cover half of your requirements and have monumental barriers
        to entry as their solutions require costly licenses, stacks, proprietary frameworks and data
        models, etc.
      </li>
      <li><b>Cost:</b> As per Gartner, to be successful with digital business transformation and
        optimization, CIOs and IT Leaders must work hard to reduce the IT budget and increase the
        bottom line.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Enterprises are looking for platform-based solutions and the new era of the cloud needs to
      empower these enterprises with an array of product development tools to bring innovation
      in-house. The solution?  Build <b>a flexible and adaptable Enterprise Platform</b> thereby allowing
      your organization to create innovative Business Applications. A couple years ago, <u>we
      realized
      the majority of organizations, even the one we were part of, had the same common problems.</u>
      They had to innovate and adapt quickly to many changes in their market.
    </p>
    <p>

      We offer a complete <b>Enterprise Platform</b> to build autoscaling Service Oriented Architecture
      (SOA) based solutions. Our aPaaS is <b>the richest integrated and harmonized platform on the
      market</b> covering all the development pipeline needs from framework, API Management & Lifecycle,
      Continuous Integration & Delivery to Metrics. And, it is adapts to legacy solutions -- the
      enterprise does not have to adapt to it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>API Management, Lifecycle and Gateway:</b> Build a homogenous API catalog by leveraging what
        you
        have. Do not start from scratch!
      </li>
      <li><b>Multi-Tenancy, Multi-Security and Multi-Environment:</b> Create economies of scale and
        accelerate time to market. Reusability is profitability
      </li>
      <li><b>Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery:</b> Release with the click of a button.
        Speed Speed Speed
      </li>
      <li><b>Cloud orchestration & distributed architecture:</b> Leverage any cloud provider as well
        as you own private cloud. Move any system you have on the cloud in minutes
      </li>
