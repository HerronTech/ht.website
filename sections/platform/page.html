    <h1>Our Platform</h1>
    <p>
      SOAJS is an enterprise Application Platform as a Service (APaaS) that enables all size of
      enterprises to accomplish a digital transformation seamlessly through a pain free
      technology upgrade and by redefining an engineering culture without creating a
      culture clash.</p>
    <p>
      SOAJS empowers enterprises with the ability to digitize their technology eco system in
      order to improve internal and external product delivery and achieve greater ROI,
      Quality, Standardization and Speed through the provisioning of a platform for
      Development, API Lifecycle & Management, Deployment and Operations Dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>

      SOAJS setup is complete within days to weeks and provides a stable and agile
      enterprise core that can immediately launch digital products. It includes infrastructure,
      software, code/language, cloud service agnostic, and it can sit on top of or it can
      bridge to any legacy systems without the need for extensive, time consuming,
      disruptive and expensive IT changes. Additions, modifications and new product
      launches can be made on the fly going forward and "Digital Darwinism" can be avoided.
      It is not sector limited - can be used in all types of businesses (from Banking Services,
      Retail, Media, Distribution, etc.), whether long established or newly created.

    </p>
    <p>
      For example, for a bank this means launching a digital banking app that allows
      customers to easily execute banking transactions, not just view account balances; for
      large retail it means creating a shopping cart and experience that has none of the
      delays that lead to lost conversions or even lost customers; for insurance companies it
      means receiving premiums, processing claims and making settlement payments online;
      and for M & A it means integrating the operations, data and financial information of the
      merged companies within weeks of closing, not years, and being able to jump on
      market opportunities rather than passing them up to more nimble competitors
    </p>

    <h2>Pillars</h2>
    <p>
      As a result, SOAJS is poised to become the key player in the new era of digital
      transformation. SOAJS was built by engineers for engineers in a tactical way to
      guarantee rapid execution at all stages of development, management, deployment and
      administration.</p>
