    <h1>Our Platform</h1>
    <p>
      SOAJS is an enterprise Application Platform as a Service (APaaS) that enables all size of
      enterprises to accomplish a digital transformation seamlessly through a pain free
      technology upgrade and by redefining an engineering culture without creating a
      culture clash.</p>
    <p>
      SOAJS empowers enterprises with the ability to digitize their technology eco system in
      order to improve internal and external product delivery and achieve greater ROI,
      Quality, Standardization and Speed through the provisioning of a platform for
      Development, API Lifecycle & Management, Deployment and Operations Dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>

      SOAJS setup is complete within days to weeks and provides a stable and agile
      enterprise core that can immediately launch digital products. It includes infrastructure,
      software, code/language, cloud service agnostic, and it can sit on top of or it can
      bridge to any legacy systems without the need for extensive, time consuming,
      disruptive and expensive IT changes. Additions, modifications and new product
      launches can be made on the fly going forward and "Digital Darwinism" can be avoided.
      It is not sector limited - can be used in all types of businesses (from Banking Services,
      Retail, Media, Distribution, etc.), whether long established or newly created.

    </p>
    <p>
      For example, for a bank this means launching a digital banking app that allows
      customers to easily execute banking transactions, not just view account balances; for
      large retail it means creating a shopping cart and experience that has none of the
      delays that lead to lost conversions or even lost customers; for insurance companies it
      means receiving premiums, processing claims and making settlement payments online;
      and for M & A it means integrating the operations, data and financial information of the
      merged companies within weeks of closing, not years, and being able to jump on
      market opportunities rather than passing them up to more nimble competitors
    </p>

    <h2>Pillars</h2>
    <p>
      As a result, SOAJS is poised to become the key player in the new era of digital
      transformation. SOAJS was built by engineers for engineers in a tactical way to
      guarantee rapid execution at all stages of development, management, deployment and
      administration.</p>

    <p>
      SOAJS is a coherently horizontally integrated solution that covers all the necessary
      pillars needed to help achieve the 4 important KPIs:
    <ul>
    <li><span class="carrot-txt">Develop</span> (Micro services, Daemons, SOA, API, Crazy throughput, …)</li>
    <li><span class="appleBlossom-txt">Manage</span> (API Management, lifecycle & productization, Multi-tenancy & security,
        …)
      </li>
    <li><span class="viridian-txt">Deploy</span> (Multi-environment, Continuous integration & deployment, Container, …)</li>
    <li><span class="calypso-txt">Operate</span> (Admin dashboard, ACL, Analytics, Monitoring, …)</li>

    </ul>

    </p>


    <h3 class="carrot-txt">
      <i class="gray-txt icon-cogs"></i>Develop</h3>
    <p>
    SOAJS empowers engineers with a cutting edge framework to build APIs capable of
    running on any data source or existing technology within the enterprise. SOAJS is a data
    model free framework with a <strong>crucial feature that allows it to wrap any existing layer
    of technology and avoid reengineering the entire infrastructure</strong>. It also offers total
    flexibility to integrate any data source chosen by the Organization.

    </p><p>
    While providing extreme flexibility with regards to applying business logic, it offers a
    headache free environment for implementing fundamental back end or basic layers
    including security (key, oAuth, device, geo location, ACL), multi-tenancy, scalability,
    maintainability and SOA. The benefit to deploying our architecture is that any enterprise
    will experience a 70% boost in its product development. The pillar can be completed
    by programming the missing 30% API code specific to each individual company’s
    needs.</p>


    <h3 class="appleBlossom-txt">
      <i class="gray-txt icon-home-manage"></i>Manage</h3>
    <p>
      SOAJS offers an API management pillar comprising full blown API management,
      lifecycle and gateway management, including productization and multi-tenancy
      functionality. This pillar is 100% complete requiring no coding. Configure it on the fly
      and experience its efficiency and powerful analytics.
    </p>

    <h3 class="viridian-txt">
      <i class="gray-txt icon-home-deploy"></i>Deploy</h3>
    <p>Deployment of a server stack has never been easier. Features that are imperative to a
      digital transformation include auto awareness, continuous deployment, cloud elasticity
      (auto scaling), monitoring, alerting, powerful and efficient analytics, cloud support,container deployment,
      and much more. This pillar is 100% complete requiring no
      coding. Deploying and scaling SOAJS is as simple as a “click click click- done. That
      easy”™.</p>

    <h3 class="calypso-txt">
      <i class="gray-txt icon-home-operate"></i>Operate</h3>
    <p>With the code being written, APIs are managed and the environment is up and running
      for operating in a live production. A state of the art dashboard is imperative at this stage
      to manage operations and ensure ROI is achieved. SOAJS empowers the enterprise
      with a ready to use dashboard that fully manages and operates all products. The
      operate pillar requires personalization coding amounting to 40% of overall code of the
      dashboard UI/UX.</p>

  <h2>Why SOAJS</h2>
  <p>
  SOAJS is the only complete APaaS to build auto scaling SOA based solutions. It is also
  open source with a community that provides constant improvements and updates led
  by the SOAJS founder, Herron. By using SOAJS, enterprises are able to effortlessly
  transform to a digital ecosystem and achieve with certainty the 4 fundamental KPIs.

  </p><p>
  Until now, there was no “silver bullet” or out of the box solution to facilitate building and
  scaling a coherently horizontal integrated product infrastructure (APaaS). Subsets or
  partial solutions are available as enterprise and open source products but combining
  and integrating them into a unified solution like SOAJS will take months to build and at
  great cost. However you will end up with a very limited solution that requires constant
  updates and fixes and limited to specific needs which contradicts where you should be
  with digitization.
</p><p>
  Forward thinking enterprises who wish to focus their resources on product
  development should adopt SOAJS to ensure a secure, stable and reliable foundation to
  simplify the IT environment and enable innovation with the speed and agility necessary
  to stay ahead of the competition without the cost of disruption. With SOAJS pillars
  (Develop - Manage - Deploy - Operate) enterprises can build auto scaling SOA based
  solutions.
