    <h1>A change is happening
      There</h1>

    <p>
      There is a paradigm shift in the software industry, and enterprises both large and small
      recognize that in order to scale, optimize, achieve high ROI and increase profitability,
      they must adopt a digital transformation strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital transformation is the use of emerging technology to fundamentally improve
      productivity and performance while reducing costs. Enterprises going through a digital
      transformation will represents a 2.2 trillion dollar market in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2020, 50% of the Global 2000 will see the majority of their business depend on their
      ability to create digitally-enhanced products, services, and experiences.

    </p>
    <p>
      By 2020, all enterprises' performance will be measured by a demanding new set of
      digital transformation-driven benchmarks. At least 1/3 of leaders in every industry will
      fail to clear these digital transformation hurdles.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
    Many enterprises claim to have completed their digital transformation or are in the
    process of achieving it.
    </p><p>
    But have they achieved their goal? To be successful, it is necessary to achieve 4
    important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):</p>

    <p>
     <i></i>ROI (Increase Profitability)
      <i></i>Speed Speed Speed (Agility)
      <i></i>Quality (Customer Satisfaction)
      <i></i>Standardization (Globalization)
    </p>
    <p>
    As Clayton Christensen from Harvard Business School mentioned, the reason it is so
    difficult for existing firms to capitalize on disruptive innovations is that their processes
    and their business model, [which] make them good at the existing business, actually
    make them bad at competing for the disruption.</p>
