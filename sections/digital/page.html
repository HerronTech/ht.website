    <h1>A change is happening</h1>

    <p>
      There is a paradigm shift in the software industry, and enterprises both large and small
      recognize that in order to scale, optimize, achieve high ROI and increase profitability,
      they must adopt a digital transformation strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital transformation is the use of emerging technology to fundamentally improve
      productivity and performance while reducing costs. Enterprises going through a digital
      transformation will represents a 2.2 trillion dollar market in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2020, 50% of the Global 2000 will see the majority of their business depend on their
      ability to create digitally-enhanced products, services, and experiences.

    </p>
    <p>
      By 2020, all enterprises' performance will be measured by a demanding new set of
      digital transformation-driven benchmarks. At least 1/3 of leaders in every industry will
      fail to clear these digital transformation hurdles.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Many enterprises claim to have completed their digital transformation or are in the
      process of achieving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But have they achieved their goal? To be successful, it is necessary to achieve 4
      important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):</p>


    <ul>
      <li>
        <i class="fa icon-roi kimberly-txt" aria-hidden="true"></i>ROI (Increase Profitability)</li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa icon-velocity kimberly-txt" aria-hidden="true"></i>Speed Speed Speed (Agility)</li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa icon-quality kimberly-txt" aria-hidden="true"></i>Quality (Customer Satisfaction)</li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa icon-globalization kimberly-txt" aria-hidden="true"></i>Standardization (Globalization)</li>


    </ul>
    <p>
      As Clayton Christensen from Harvard Business School mentioned, the reason it is so
      difficult for existing firms to capitalize on disruptive innovations is that their processes
      and their business model, [which] make them good at the existing business, actually
      make them bad at competing for the disruption.</p>

    <p>
      We understand your pain; You want to innovate and fast, you dream of launching new
      products or services within a click.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have great ideas but technology, speed, and cost are showstoppers instead of
      enablers:
    </p>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>You have legacy systems preventing you to move fast.</li>
      <li>You don’t have the knowledge, there are too many possibilities and the solutions
      are evolving too fast.</li>
      <li>Your technology team spend too much time building components with too few
      value (as a differentiator) for your product (security, oAuth, ACL, Admin
      Management Dashboard, etc.)</li>
      <li>You look for Enterprise Solutions to solve everything, but it is too costly and it
      doesn't give you the velocity you need nor the agility you are looking forward to
      achieve.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Reality</h2>
    <p>By its very nature, digital transformation requires a change in culture and a major
      technology upgrade to enable agility and to create and deploy digital products and
      services in a “lean and mean” way - i.e. homogenous deployment, use of a common
      programming language, SOA, microservices, reduced resource requirements, and
      fastest time to market at reduced costs.</p>
    <p>All too often digital transformation is viewed as a daunting challenge requiring
      significant costs over extended periods of time, and creating major disruptions
      internally and externally. As a result compromises in quality are made, and piecemeal
      or bolt on products are launched with a high degree of customer dissatisfaction. Money
      is wasted and critical time to market is lost, sometimes irretrievably and leading to
      company failure.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, for many companies existing technologies left no other choice - the
      alternative was too daunting or simply beyond the means of the company. Until now. . .</p>
