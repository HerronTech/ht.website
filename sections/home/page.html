                    Herron Tech has leveraged the SOAJS Open Source Platform to provide an array of turnkey software
                    products that are designed to significantly increase stability, standardization and ROI, while

                    A couple years ago, we realized that the organizations that we were a part of had something in
                    common. They had to innovate and adapt quickly to many changes in their market. In 2015 we went on a
                    mission to build a smart solution to help enterprises of all sizes to achieve digital transformation
                    in a quick and efficient way.

                <p>
                    As a result we launched SOAJS; an open source application platform initiative built by engineers for
                    engineers in a tactical way for rapid execution at all stages of the digital transformation. SOAJS
                    was created by the founders of Herron Tech and is now supported by a global community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SOAJS is the only complete Enterprise Open Source aPaaS to build auto-scaling SOA based solutions to
                    achieve the digital transformation efficiently and seamlessly. SOAJS is maintained by top-notch
                    engineers around the globe as an Open Source community today..
                </p>

                <p>
                    To make sure we are steering this initiative into the right direction, we worked closely with
                    different enterprises from all sizes (from startups to billion dollar publicly traded enterprises)
                    to help solving this complex problem in a versatile way. We can proudly say that we found the right
                    solution that can be installed locally or on any cloud in just minutes.
