					Innovation, Time-to-Market, Standardization, Speed, Speed, Speed and Fail Fast – these are
					just a
					few of the terms that you will hear from us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our mission is to empower enterprises with the digital business agility required to
					respond quickly
					and effectively to emerging threats to their business, and proactively seize new market
					opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Herron Tech has leveraged the SOAJS Open Source Platform to provide an array of turnkey
					software
					products that are designed to significantly increase stability, standardization and ROI,
					while
					decreasing valuable time-to-market.
				</p>
				<p>
					A couple years ago, we realized the majority of organizations, even the one we were part
					of, all had the same common problems.
					They had to innovate and adapt quickly to many changes in their market. In 2015 we went on
					a
					mission to build a smart solution to help enterprises of all sizes to achieve digital
					transformation
					in a quick and efficient way.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result we launched SOAJS, an open source microservices management platform initiative built by
					engineers for
					engineers in a tactical way for rapid execution at all stages of the digital
					transformation.
					SOAJS was created by the founders of Herron Tech and is now supported by a global community.

					SOAJS is a Complete & Adaptive solution to integrate client Environments into Infrastructures by
					breaking the silos, modernizing & harmonizing existing IT infrastructures, bringing calm to chaos,

				</p>
				<p>
					SOAJS solves the manageability problem and the complexity behind implementing a microservices
					architecture. No need to worry about the complexity and the huge IT plumbing challenges behind this
					effort.
				</p>
				<p>
					SOAJS is the only complete, end-to-end microservices management platform, SOAJS eliminates the IT

				<p>
					To make sure we are steering this initiative into the right direction, we worked closely
					with
					different enterprises from all sizes (from startups to billion dollar publicly traded
					enterprises)
					to help solve this complex problem in a versatile way. We can proudly say that we found
					the right
					solution that can be installed locally or on any cloud in just minutes.
