							Transforming from a traditional environment to a digital organization requires lots of IT plumbing <i>(Undifferentiated heavy lifting - Hybrid integration, API management and lifecycle, Multi cloud management and orchestration, Fast delivery, Analytics and Operating, & Adaptable framework)</i> that requires time and talents preventing enterprises from achieving agility and speed. Unfortunately nowadays with all the tools in the market, there isn’t a solution that allows you to write your code and push a button to be up and running. Lots of plumbing is required, and it gets even more complicated after your first release.

				<p>
					Our mission is to empower enterprises with the digital business agility required to
					respond quickly
					and effectively to emerging threats to their business, and proactively seize new market
					opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Herron Tech has leveraged the SOAJS Open Source Platform to provide an array of turnkey
					software
					products that are designed to significantly increase stability, standardization and ROI,
					while
					decreasing valuable time-to-market.
				</p>
				<p>
					A couple years ago, we realized the majority of organizations, even the one we were part
					of, all had the same common problems.
					They had to innovate and adapt quickly to many changes in their market. In 2015 we went on
					a
					mission to build a smart solution to help enterprises of all sizes to achieve digital
					transformation
					in a quick and efficient way.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>
					As a result we launched SOAJS, an open source application platform initiative built by
					engineers for
					engineers in a tactical way for rapid execution at all stages of the digital
					transformation. SOAJS
					was created by the founders of Herron Tech and is now supported by a global community.
				</p>
				<p>
					SOAJS is the only complete Enterprise Open Source aPaaS to build auto-scaling SOA based
					solutions to
					achieve digital transformation efficiently and seamlessly. SOAJS is maintained by
					top-notch
					engineers around the globe as an Open Source community today with the following values:
					Fast, Free, &
					Flexible.
				</p>

				<p>
					To make sure we are steering this initiative into the right direction, we worked closely
					with
					different enterprises from all sizes (from startups to billion dollar publicly traded
					enterprises)
					to help solve this complex problem in a versatile way. We can proudly say that we found
					the right
					solution that can be installed locally or on any cloud in just minutes.
