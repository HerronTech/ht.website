    <h1>A CHANGE IS HAPPENING AND ENTERPRISES OF ALL SIZES MUST TRANSFORM TO AVOID GETTING TRAPPED IN THE TURMOIL CAUSED
      BY THE DIGITAL VORTEX</h1>

    <p>Achieving digital transformation demands that you upgrade your existing platform to become agile and solve
      complex problems in this rapidly evolving software environment. Yet upgrading your platform is not an easy task –
      multiple challenges need to be overcome if you want to move fast and avoid multiple iterations.

    </p>
    <p>Many IT organizations claim that they can help and have the right platform to help achieve digital
      transformation. Unfortunately, only 17% of IT organizations are effective partners in the business of digital
      transformation. (Source: IDC, Leading in 3D Maturity Model - Benchmark, 2016; n= 160 IT Executives, January, 2016)

    </p>
    <p>Among those who can help, the question is: “Who has the right platform without disrupting the enterprise or
      ending up costing a great deal of money, time and effort?”

    </p>
    <p>Lots of buzz exists today about companies claiming that they have a solution for digital transformation. However
      even a cursory review of their websites reveals a lot of talk about processes and standardization.

    </p>
    <p>You might ask “why?”

    </p>
    <p>Digital transformation using these solutions is a heavy lifting journey that involves substantial amounts of time
      and money. These solutions require you to adapt to them. Adopt their processes. Adopt their standards. That could
      be their proprietary, limited framework, their data model, their container technology, and so on.

    </p>
    <p>Most of the time, this makes it all but impossible to leverage what you already have. This means replacing all of
      your software investments, followed by additional investments to migrate your existing products to these
      technologies – and, moreover, you must then retrain the entire organization.

    </p>
    <p>Until now, there has not been a single platform that provides you with all the features you need without
      disrupting your company!

    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard was built to eliminate these problems and help you upgrade without any pain. Equipped with a
      framework that is data model agnostic, it allows you to quickly build new APIs or easily wrap around any existing
      ones. It also offers API Management with a multitude of features that every product requires regardless of
      application: multi-security – multi-tenancy – multi-environment – productization – gateway – and more. This makes
      Herron the ideal platform to help you build, integrate, deploy, scale, orchestrate, monitor, manage, and test all
      the systems and APIs that you have now -- or those that you build in the future.

    </p>
    <p>Herron’s platform adapts to you. Use most of what you have without incurring a disruption to change your
      resources and systems. Herron Dashboard helps you extend, migrate, and deploy what you already have. Use its
      catalog recipes and shift your existing systems to use its pipeline (dashboard) without changing your existing
      code or even building drivers.

    </p>
    <p>We built our platform to be container agnostic and compatible with most of the open source technologies like
      Docker, Kubernetes, Triton and others from day one. It is a simple matter of adding a driver to support any new
      container technology.

    </p>
    <p>And there is no limitation when it comes to choosing which service provider you would like to use. We are cloud
      agnostic, supporting most of the public cloud providers AWS – Google – Joyent – Rackspace – Azure and even a mix
      of them as well as private cloud technologies.

    </p>
    <p>Release new products and subsequent versions with the click of a button. All the while Herron empowers you with
      its multi-tenancy and productization capabilities. Achieve economies of scale and accelerate your time to market.
      Click. Click. You’re done.

    </p>
    <p>Benefit from the Dashboard’s pipeline deployment capabilities: scale, orchestrate, deploy, and update by using
      its interface. This eliminates the headaches of learning new technologies, whether integrating, orchestrating, or
      using containers and/or cloud technologies.

    </p>
    <p>In addition, Herron offers API & Daemon catalog management, multi-tenancy, multi-security, multi-environment, and
      multi-version layers to all components deployed on its pipeline. No coding required. Simply deploy your systems
      and start managing.

    </p>
    <p>Multi-tenant systems allow you to reuse the same code and systems with different clients (tenants), with
      additional security, configuration, and management. With Herron Dashboard, your engineers do not need to write any
      code in order to turn on multi-tenancy and configure the extra security and provisioning information.

    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard also offers a middleware package that may be included in your code, making the system that runs
      this code aware of all the benefits that SOAJS offers.

    </p>
    <p>When it comes to updates & upgrades, Herron Dashboard integrates with multiple providers: Travis, Drone, Jenkins,
      TeamCity… If you already use any of these to automate build and deployment, simply configure Herron Dashboard to
      sync with them and watch the magic happen. The minute your engineer pushes code updates to a repo, Herron
      Dashboard pulls the update, analyzes it, identifies the affected systems, and, if configured to auto update, will
      do so. Otherwise it will notify you to take action.

    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard is also equipped with an analytics infrastructure powered by ELK that allows you to monitor,
      troubleshoot, and collect metrics and business intelligence from all deployed systems, in all environments. You
      can focus on improving the quality of your products. Herron Dashboard analytics can also be configured to forward
      analytics information to 3rd parties like Datadog, Galileo, Runscope, and others…

    </p>
    <p>Enable your engineers to focus entirely on the product they are building, instead of wasting up to 60% of their
      time on developing and maintaining core infrastructure.

    </p>
    <b>Herron Dashboard is the only Enterprise Platform capable of performing these tasks -- in a matter of
      minutes the platform is up and running.</b>
    <p><strong>Click. Click. You’re done. It’s that easy &trade;</strong></p>
