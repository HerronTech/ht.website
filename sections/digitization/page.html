      A change is happening and enterprises of all sizes must transform to avoid falling into the
      turmoil of the digital vortex
    </h1>


    <p>Many IT organizations claim that they can help and they have the right platform to help achieve digital transformation. Unfortunately, only 17% of IT organizations are effective partners in the business of
    digital transformation - Source: IDC, Leading in 3D Maturity Model - Benchmark, 2016;
      n= 160 IT Executives, January, 2016
    </p>
    <p>Among those who can help, the question is “Who has the right platform without disrupting the
      enterprise and end up costing a great deal of money, time and effort”?
    </p>
    <p>Achieving digital transformation demands that you upgrade your existing platform to become
      agile, lean, mean and disruptive. Yet upgrading your platform is not an easy task; multiple
      challenges take place and if you are about to embark on such a mission, you need to move fast
      and avoid multiple iterations.
    </p>
    <p> Lots of buzz exists today about companies claiming that they have a solution for digital
      transformation. However a cursory review of their website will reveal that they talk a lot
      about processes and standardization.
    </p>
    <p> Ask why? Digital transformation using these solutions is a heavy lifting journey that will
      require a substantial amount of time and money.
    </p>
    <p> Currently available solutions today require that you change everything you have in place
      because it requires that you use their proprietary and limited framework, cloud, and so on so
      forth. Most of the time, nothing is adaptable to what you have.
    </p>
    <p> Until now, there has not been a single platform that provides you with all these features
      without disrupting your company! Most solutions impose the use of their data model and
      framework to be able to help you. This means replacing all of your software investments and
      moreover you must retrain the entire organization, followed by additional investments to
      migrate your existing products to these technologies.
    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard was built to eliminate these problems and help you upgrade without any pain.
      It is equipped with a framework that is data model free that allows you to build new APIs or
      wrap around any existing system. It also offers API Management with a multitude of features
      that every product requires regardless of what the product does; multi-security –
      multi-tenancy – multi-environment – productization – gateway ... etc.
    </p>
    <p>We have the ideal platform to help you build, integrate, deploy, scale, orchestrate, monitor,
      manage, and test all the systems and APIs that you have now or those that you desire to build
      in the future. In addition, our platform will adapt to most of what you have and does not
      impose a disruption to changing all your resources and systems while empowering you with
      multi-tenancy and productization to help you achieve economy of scale and the ability to
      release new products and subsequent releases with a click of a button accelerating time to
      market.
    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard also helps you extend, migrate and deploy what you already have with
      absolutely no barrier to entry. Use its catalog recipes and shift your existing systems to use
      its pipeline (dashboard) without changing your existing code or even build drivers.
    </p>
    <p>Benefit from dashboard pipeline deployment capability; scale, orchestrate, deploy and update
      by using its interface which removes the headache of learning new technologies whether to
      integrate, orchestrate or use containers and/or cloud technologies.
    </p>
    <p>From day one, we built our platform to be container agnostic compatible with most of the open
      source technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Triton and others. It is a matter of adding a
      driver to support any new container technology.
    </p>
    <p>With us there is no limitation when it comes to choosing which service provider you would
      like to use. We are cloud agnostic and we support most of the public cloud providers AWS –
      Google – Joyent – Rackspace – Azure and even a mix of them as well as private cloud
      technologies. click click … you’re done!
    </p>
    <p>In addition, we offer API & Daemon catalog Management, multi-tenancy, multi-security,
      multi-environment and multi-version layers to all components deployed on its pipeline with no
      coding effort whatsoever. Simply deploy your systems and start managing.
    </p>
    <p>Multi-tenant systems allow you to reuse the same code and the same systems with different
      clients (tenants) and offer additional security, configuration and management. With Herron
      Dashboard, your engineers do not need to write any code when it comes to turning on
      multi-tenancy and configuring the extra security and provisioning information.
    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard also offers a middleware package that you may include in your code and the
      system that runs this code becomes aware of all the benefits that SOAJS offers.
    </p>
    <p>When it comes to updates & upgrades, Herron Dashboard integrates with multiple of providers:
      Travis, Drone, Jenkins, TeamCity… If you already use any of these systems to automate your
      build and deployment, simply configure Herron Dashboard to sync with them and watch the magic
      happen. The minute your engineer pushes code updates to a repo, Herron Dashboard pulls the
      update, analyze it, identifies the affected systems and if configured to auto update it will
      do so otherwise it will notify you to take action.
    </p>
    <p>Herron Dashboard is also equipped with an analytic infrastructure powered by ELK that allows
      you to monitor, troubleshoot and collect metrics and BI from all deployed systems in all
      environments and focus on improving the quality of your products. Herron Dashboard analytics
      can also be configured to forward analytics information to 3rd parties like Datadog, Galileo,
      Runscope and other…
    </p>
    <p>Push your engineers to focus 100% on the product they are building instead of wasting up to
      60% on developing and maintaining a core platform.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Herron Dashboard is the only Enterprise Platform capable of performing these tasks
      -- in
      a matter of minutes the platform is up and running.</strong></p>
